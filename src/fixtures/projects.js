    This application is based on bootstrap and tachyons for styling,
    And Django powered by Django Rest Framework on the backend.
    The frontend logic and presentation was constructed using React and all the state management uses Redux.
    This is the one and only project, even though small, I put effort on the presentation side, 
    I usually prefer to skip this and jump straight to the logic challenges, 
    but with this one I learned a bunch about bootstrap specially, it was a fun project.`,
